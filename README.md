# Jenkins on Kubernetes
More power for your CI on Kubernetes!

## What is it?
This repository provides a set of convenient definitions and scripts to help you easily set up, maintain and extend Jenkins as a service within a Kubernetes cluster. The aim is to make use of Jenkins power and flexibility to provide you with a feature rich CI / CD solution that is able to deploy multiple software components within your Kubernetes cluster, and depending upon your configuration, also promote those same software components into other environments. The solution offered here is opinioniated, in the sense that it aims to provide a good solution to companies that deploy software-as-a-service and consist of one or more development teams and one or more DevOps engineers that have responsibility across all of those teams.
